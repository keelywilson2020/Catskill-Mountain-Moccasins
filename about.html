                <p>Catskill Mountain Moccasins was founded in 1987 in Woodstock, New York, by Mark Goldfarb and Diane Genninger. Today, we're a family of dedicated artisans with over 125 years of combined experience in crafting high-quality moccasins.</p>
                
                <p>Together with Lynn Collins, we began our journey by exhibiting at renaissance festivals and craft fairs across the country. From the start, we've been committed to creating exceptional footwear, offering outstanding customer service, and fostering a strong sense of family and shared values among our team. That dedication has fueled our steady, organic growth, and today, we're proud to be the most experienced custom footwear company in the United States.</p>
                
                <p>Over the past 38 years, nearly four decades, a number of incredibly talented artisans have joined our team. Some were trained through Mark's apprenticeship program, while others brought their own expertise as accomplished footwear designers.</p>
                
                <p>Though we come from diverse backgrounds, we share a common goal: to design, create, and deliver the most comfortable footwear you'll ever own.</p>

                                <p>After purchasing his first pair of custom footwear at the age of 16, Lynn knew that his calling in life was to create comfortable footwear for other people. He was fortunate to meet and apprentice with several moccasin makers in northern California where he lived at the time, before heading off on his own, eventually joining the Catskills family of artisans. Forty-six years and several thousand pairs of moccasins later, Lynn is still enjoying his craft and going strong at it! When not making moccasins, he enjoys spending time with his family, riding his horses and exploring the beautiful southern Colorado mountains where he lives.</p>

                                <p>Born in Austin and raised in Dallas, Eric's life was largely normal and uneventful until he discovered moccasins! It was love at first sight. As soon as he saw Catskill's beautiful wares, he had to have a pair of his own. Then he horrified his friends by immediately slicing them up to see how they were made! But he got them back together again, and his apprenticeship had begun. Eric moved from his beloved Texas to Woodstock, NY to learn the craft of moccasin making from Catskill Mountain's founder, Mark Goldfarb. He returned to Texas a master Maker, and that's where he can be found when he's not travelling to various shows across the country to bring the world's most comfortable custom footwear to everyone!</p>

                                <p>This elusive and curious Maker began his journey with Catskills way back in 2008. Growing up in a military family, and after years of working in the international gaming industry, Kurt was already accustomed to traveling, and for many years was running from fair to fair helping our family of customers and making new ones. While he still owns and manages many of our Catskills booths, these days you can usually find him at his home in TX, raising his son and making our one-of-a-kind footwear, working hard to continue helping our moccasin family grow. On days when he has some free time, he likes to go fishing with his son.</p>

Before becoming a Maker, Mike primarily worked in construction and auto repair. If it's broken, Mike is the guy that will know how to fix it. Mike is known in our company for his insanely ornate stitching abilities. We simply don't understand how he does it, but we're happy he does! A giant of a man, you may also recognize him from renaissance festival stages, where he plays his absolutely enormous drum in the band Celtic Legacy. When he's not making moccasins, he enjoys tending his garden and raising his six children.</p>

By far the slowest Maker in the company, Matt is unapologetically obsessed with the details and never lets a pair of moccasins leave his shop until they're exactly right. He's not fast, but his work is as clean as it gets. In his spare time, he enjoys reading, cooking for friends and family, and traveling with his beautiful better half. A seasoned musician, you can find him playing music at renaissance festivals around the country, as he is also a member of two national touring bagpipe bands, Tartanic and Celtic Legacy, in addition to his original contemporary project, Upstart Crow.</p>

Her favorite part of making moccasins is opening up a fresh shipment of hides, and letting the smell of leather engulf her like a warm hug. Heather specializes in carvings, with a particular gift for mixing dyes and paints for exact color matches. When she's not making moccasins, she enjoys drawing in nature, hiking, and spending time with her daughter. </p>

                                <p>Living in California, Suellyn first came into contact with our moccasins through a friend who was involved in selling, as well as making them. She purchased her first pair around 1978 and wondered to what degree she could interpret design in leather, through appliques and other techniques. With a move to Aspen in May of 1980, she was able to get a job with some moccasin Makers there. Little did she know it would turn into a life's work, but here she is 40 years later, still loving the work! Suellyn specializes in intricate appliques and layered work, interpreting our customers' dreams and ideas, while adding her own, and creating comfortable leather footwear that they will enjoy for many years.</p>

Originally from southern California, Mike first became interested in moccasins as a young teenager when he saw a performance of Sonny & Cher, and was drawn instantly to their killer footwear. Little did he know that a few years later he would meet the Makers of those moccasins, and learn how to make them himself! He was already an experienced leather worker, having taught himself how to make moccasins in the side-laced Apache style, but fell in love with the now iconic style and techniques of Catskill Mountain Moccasins. Thousands of pairs later, he's still at it! Mike's favorite part of making moccasins is the detail of the finishing work - cleaning up the edges, and putting in those little final touches that really make a moccasin beautiful.</p>

                                <p>Maxime is a consummate artist, through and through. Their ability to envision and bring to life new ideas is truly remarkable. Before making moccasins, Max was the creator of custom-fit corsets with intricate stitching and design work - a natural precursor to making moccasins! Maxime's favorite part of making moccasins is when they get the chance to make high realism carved and painted fantasy designs. These designs certainly take time, but Max treats each and every pair like a masterpiece, and simply will not rush perfection! When Max isn't making moccasins, they put their attention to detail towards crafting leather items of a spicier variety (search online for Mad Minx Creations). When they're not working with leather, they enjoy foraging and hiking with their dogs, kayaking, and drawing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tommy Lee Jones and Benecio Del Toro in The Hunted (2003):</strong><br>
                    Catskill Mountain Moccasins was first contacted by the assistant costume designer for The Hunted nearly two years before the film’s release. A meeting was quickly arranged in New York with costume designer Gloria Gresham to discuss the film’s visual direction and how our moccasins could contribute to the look. Impressed by our work, Gloria later invited us to join the production team in Portland, Oregon.
<p>Despite a major East Coast snowstorm, we made it to Portland on time—expecting a short stay and a small order. What began as a couple pairs for Tommy Lee Jones and Benecio Del Toro, turned into a two-week collaboration and 23 custom pairs of moccasins, including one for director William Friedkin. Fittings were done on-site, with materials overnighted to our studio where Lynn crafted each pair with precision and speed. All footwear was delivered on time and with exceptional quality.
<p>Working on the film was a deeply rewarding experience. We were inspired by the dedication of the cast and crew, and proud to see our craftsmanship featured on screen.</p>

                <div class="tab-option">
                  <p><strong>Standard</strong> - Our standard tabs are a stitched triangular tab made from bullhide, included at no extra charge in our basic moccasin design. Available in whatever color you want, this option is on us! </p>

                  <p><strong>Laminated</strong> - An easy and subtle way to add a little "pop" to your tabs, a laminated tab includes a thin layer of deer hide, for those who want that extra splash of color. Laminated tabs with contrasting stitching especially make our hearts happy! </p>

                  <p><strong>Shaped</strong> - Made from bullhide, shaped tabs are ideal for simple, one-color customizations. Anything from leaves to feathers to flames, shaped tabs are a fun way to add a specialty touch to your design. Have something particular in mind? Was your nickname in high school "Lightning Bolt?" Sure, we can do that!</p>

                <div class="tab-option">
                  <p><strong>Carved</strong> - With carved tabs, the sky is the limit for creativity. This option allows us to include the most amount of detail in the smallest amount of space. With each one being hand-carved, dyed, and painted, carved tabs are endlessly customizable, and truly fall into the "whatever you can think of" category of creation. </p>

                <div class="tab-option">
                  <p><strong>Natural</strong> - Like the rough and rugged look? Us too! These tabs are cut from the natural edge of the buffalo hide, so each one is a little different, in the true "mountain man" style. Want an even more rugged look? No problem! We'd be happy to add a natural deerhide underlay!</p>

                  <p><strong>Burned</strong> - A burned heel piece is a great way to incorporate designs with a fair amount of line work, without adding any extra material to the heel itself. </p>
